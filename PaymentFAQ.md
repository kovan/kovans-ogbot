### Q: How does SMS payment work? ###

A: It's simple: You send an SMS to the number of your country, and you will receive another SMS with a code. When you enter that code in the white text box and click Send, you will start downloading the bot. The amount in the orange rectangle will be charged to you phone bill.

### Q: How does PayPal payment work? ###

A: You need to have an account at http://www.paypal.com. PayPal is a payment system property of e-Bay that is frequently used in the Internet.
The procedure is simple: after payment you will receive an e-mail with a download link.

### Q: Will I have access to future versions? ###

A: The access code has a validity of one month. After that it stops working. This means that you can download new versions for one month from the moment you make the purchase. **The downloaded versions will not stop working after that month** unless OGame interface changes, in this case all bots will probably stop working.

### Q: You say that an SMS must be sent, but for my country there is no number for SMS, only for phone calls. ###

A: For some countries payment through SMS is not supported, only payments through phone call. The price is approximately the same.
The procedure is as follows: you call and you will listen to a pre-recorded message in the language of your country. After the required call time, the machine will dictate the code, which you should write down.
All this also applies when your phone company is not supported for SMS payment. Supported companies for a country are listed at the bottom of the pay page. If you send the SMS and your company is not supported you will not be charged anything.

### Q: My country doesn't appear in the list for SMS/Phone payments ###
### Q: My phone company is not supported ###

A: Some countries and/or phone companies are not supported, sorry. You can use PayPal instead.
